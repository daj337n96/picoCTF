Using a hex editor shows us BM at the start meanning this is s BMP file. 
BMP file header:
http://www.ece.ualberta.ca/~elliott/ee552/studentAppNotes/2003_w/misc/bmp_file_format/bmp_file_format.htm

Since the image cannot be opened, we can use an online photo editor(photopea).

We can see that the image has a 2Mb size for such a small image, with the BMP header info, we can edit the height at 16h offset.
After playing around with the height, we found the flag!
