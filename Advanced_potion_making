Using strings <filename>, we see "IHDR" at the start and "IEND" at the end. This means that we are dealing with a png file.
However, the file is currupted so oening it gives us an error.

This site shows us the standard that a png file header should follow. Using hexedit we changed the header and the file was restored.

Next since this is an image file, we can use stegsolve to reveal the flag, and we got it! 
Flag: picoCTF{w1z4rdry}
